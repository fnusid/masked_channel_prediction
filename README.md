# About
In this study, I investigated sound prediction with a 4-microphone array arranged in a fixed square configuration, capturing audio from a random sound source within a room. The project entailed the development of a self-supervised model leveraging a conformer architecture to predict and reconstruct the masked microphone signals.

## Key Contributions:

Room Acoustics Modeling: Utilized gpuRIR to accurately model room acoustics, simulating realistic sound environments.
Data Pipeline Creation: Designed and implemented a comprehensive pipeline, spanning from data creation to masked channel prediction.
Model Performance: Achieved a validation mean squared error (MSE) of 0.001, demonstrating high accuracy in reconstructing masked microphone signals.
